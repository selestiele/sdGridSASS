# sdGridSASS

I'm a web design/development student and I'm learning things not taught in my classes to make myself more competetive in the job market. This repository is for learning SASS (which I ADORE--where have variables been all my life??).  I have others where I'm working on similar projects but using Bootstrap or working on Wordpress themes. 

This site is a retooling of my portfolio to include both course work and professional work. In the retooling, I'm learning how to use SASS, as well as the CSS grid. The site is responsive, but has only been tested on my local network.
