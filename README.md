# sdGridSASS

I'm a web design/development student and I'm learning things not taught in my classes to make myself more competetive in the job market. This repository is for learning SASS (which I ADORE--where have variables been all my life??).  I have others where I'm working on similar projects but using Bootstrap or working on Wordpress themes.
